# 🍽️ Restaurant Menu Item Profitability Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to classify restaurant menu items based on their profitability. By leveraging **machine learning models**, we analyze various menu features and predict whether an item is **profitable** or **not profitable**. This helps restaurant owners make data-driven decisions to optimize their menu offerings and maximize revenue.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of various features related to menu items, such as:
- **Item Name**
- **Category** (Appetizer, Main Course, Dessert, etc.)
- **Price**
- **Cost to Prepare**
- **Sales Volume**
- **Customer Ratings**
- **Profit Margin**

The target variable is **Profitability**, which is classified into two categories:
- `Profitable`
- `Not Profitable`

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**
  - `Pandas` - Data Manipulation
  - `NumPy` - Numerical Computation
  - `Matplotlib & Seaborn` - Data Visualization
  - `Scikit-Learn` - Machine Learning
  - `Random Forest Classifier, KNN, Decision Tree` - Classification Models
  - `One-Hot Encoding, Min-Max Scaling` - Feature Engineering

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing key trends in the dataset
   - Understanding feature importance
3. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Implementing multiple classification models
   - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance
4. **Evaluation & Validation**
   - Comparing models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Selecting the best-performing model

## 🚀 Results & Achievements
- Achieved **95% accuracy** using **Random Forest Classifier** 🎯
- Identified key features that contribute to profitability
- Developed a classification system that helps restaurant owners optimize their menu offerings


## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Add more advanced models like **XGBoost** and **Deep Learning**
- Improve feature selection using **SHAP values**
- Deploy the model using **Flask or FastAPI** for real-world applications
